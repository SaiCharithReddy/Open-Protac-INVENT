# Open-Protac-INVENT
Source code for our paper "---". This adaptation is built on top of Protac-invent (https://github.com/jidushanbojue/Protac-invent), which itself is based on REINVENT (https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent) and DockStream (https://github.com/MolecularAI/DockStream). 


This adaptation also integrates Roshambo (https://github.com/molecularinformatics/roshambo) to enable shape-based scoring functionality. We thank the original authors of all these projects for sharing their work.
